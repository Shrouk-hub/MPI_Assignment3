# MPI_Assignment3

in this repo, there is 2 projects, the first project is the mpi_parallel_solution project, the second project is the sequential_solution project.
to run the parallel_solution project, i download mpi to visual studio 2019.
i assumed that i take a radian value of x

in parallel_solution project 
1-i used get_input function to take the inputs from the user
2-the process 0 is responsible to take the inputs and to view results
3-i used factorial function to calculate the factorial
4-i used calculation function to caculate each group of tasks that belongs to each process

in sequential_solution
1-i used factorial function to calculate the factorial
2-i used the main function to get the inputs and to calculate the summation of cos
